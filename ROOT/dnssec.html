            <p>
              An application on the Internet that translates domain names to IP
              addresses and vice-versa. In simple words, The Domain Name System
              (DNS) is a directory lookup service that provides a mapping
              between the name of a host on the Internet and its numerical
              internet address. DNS is comprised of 4 elements:

              </header>
              <p>
                The DNS database is a collection of resource record organized
                into a distributed database. It contains the information like IP
                address, name servers for this domain name.
              </p>

                <h3>Name Servers:</h3>
              </header>
              <p>
                Name Servers are server programs that hold information about a
                portion of the domain-name tree structure and the associated
                RRs.
              </p>

                <h3>Resolvers:</h3>
              </header>
              <p>
                Resolvers are programs that extract information from name
                servers in response to client request. A typical client request
                is for an IP address corresponding to a given domain name.

              <p>
                It is used by several protocols that provide e-mail security. It
                provides end-to-end protection through the use of digital
                signature. DNSSEC protects DNS clients from accepting forged DNS
                RRs. It protects these clients by using Digital Signatures to
                provide:<br />
                Data origin authentication to ensure that a RR has originated
                from the content of a RR has not been modified.<br />
                Data Integrity verification to ensure that the content of a RR
                has not been modified.

              Root Zone File is published by 13 root servers named A to M,
              operated by various operators;<br />
              13 because of logical limitations – max packet size in UDP in 512
              bytes;<br />
              Replicated; 374 instances of same are available<br />
              Each root server is a copy and none of them are special than
              others; so the number 13 is only notional<br />
              India has replicas of 3 root servers; I root at Mumbai, K root at

              Contains names and IP addresses of authoritative DNS servers for
              all TLDs, ccTLD. Any changes to root zone file is requested by

              of Commerce has full authority; while ICANN is the root zone
              operator and Verisign is the root zone maintainer.<b> ICANN </b>is

            <p>
            Fast Flux is a DNS technique used by botnets to hide various types
			of malicious activities (such as phishing, web proxying, malware delivery,
			and malware communication) behind an ever-changing network of compromised
			hosts acting as proxies. Fast Flux network is mostly used to make
			communication between malware and its command and control server.

              <h3>DNS Pharming / Cache Poisoning</h3>
            </header>
            <p>
            In DNS pharming attacker hacks into the DNS server and changes the 
			IP address for www.xyz.com to IP of www.xyz1.com (Fake page). 
			So if the user enters the URL in address bar, the computer queries
		    the DNS server for the IP address of www.xyz.com. Since the DNS server
			has already been poisoned by the attacker, it returns the IP address of www.xyz1.com (fake page).

              </header>
              </section>
			  <p>
		      DNSSEC uses Public Key Cryptography and digital signatures to provide:
              Data Origin Authentication-Did the DNS reply really come from the .com zone?
              Data Integrity-Did an attacker modify the data in the response, since it was signed?
              So, it provides protection against (corruption) spoofing of DNS Data.
