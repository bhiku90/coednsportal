              <h3>MUA (Mail User Agent)</h3>
            </header>
            <p>
              An MUA or Mail User Agent is the program that an end user uses to 
              read and process mail. Typical examples include Mozilla Thunderbird, 
              Microsoft Outlook, Eudora Mail, Incredimail or Lotus Notes. 
              Sometimes it is called an email client.
            </p>
            <header>
              <h3>MTA (Mail Transport Agent)</h3>
            </header>
            <p>
              An MTA, or Message Transfer Agent is the software and other systems 
              that are responsible for sending and receiving mail between systems 
              such as sendmail, postfix, qmail. That is the only thing MTAs do
              they send and receive messages between systems. MTAs use the SMTP 
              (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol) to send and receive messages. 
            </p>
            <header>
              <h3>SMTP (Simple Mail Transport Protocol)</h3>
            </header>
            <p>
              SMTP is part of the application layer of the TCP/IP protocol. 
              SMTP is a standard communication protocol for sending email 
              messages on business networks and the Internet. SMTP was originally 
              developed in the early 1980s and remains one of the most popular 
              protocols in use worldwide.MUAs and MTAs use this protocol for 
              sending emails.  
            </p>
            <header>
              <h3>MDA (Mail Delivery Agent)</h3>
            </header>
            <p>
             An MDA is a Mail Delivery Agent. MDAs are the software responsible 
             for receiving a message from an MTA and arranging for it to be 
             received by the local system (e.g. delivered to a mailbox). 
             Any program that actually handles a message for delivery to the 
             point where it can be read by an email client application can be 
             considered an MDA. There are two main protocols used for retrieving 
             email on an MDA:  
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>POP3 (Post Office Protocol):</b>
                    <p>MUAs use this protocol for receiving their emails from the final server. 
                        The Post Office Protocol 3 (POP3) is a mail access protocol used by a 
                        client application to read messages from the mail server. Received 
                        messages are often deleted from the server. POP supports simple 
                        download-and-delete requirements for access to remote mailboxes 
                        (termed mail drop in the POP RFC's).</p>
                </li>
                <li><b>IMAP (Internet Message Access Protocol):</b>
                    <p>MUAs can use this protocol to send and receive emails on the servers. 
                        The Internet Message Access Protocol (IMAP) provides features to manage 
                        a mailbox from multiple devices. Small portable devices like smartphones 
                        are increasingly used to check email while travelling, and to make brief 
                        replies, larger devices with better keyboard access being used to reply 
                        at greater length. IMAP shows the headers of messages, the sender and the 
                        subject and the device needs to request to download specific messages. 
                        Usually mail is left in folders in the mail server.</p>

            </header>
            <p>
                SMTPS (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol Secure) is a method for securing SMTP with TLS (transport layer security).
                It provides authentication of the communication partners, as well as data integrity and confidentiality. 
            </p>

              <h3>Need for SMTPS</h3>
            </header>
            <p>
              Because the SMTP standard sends email without using encryption or authentication, 
              every message that has been sent is exposed to view. This can cause various email 
              security threats such as: 
              <ul>
                  <li><b>Authenticity Related Threats: </b>Results in unauthorized access to an enterprise’s email system.</li>
                  <li><b>Integrity–related Threats: </b>Results in unauthorized modification of email content.</li>
                  <li><b>Confidentiality–related Threats: </b>Results in unauthorized disclosure of sensitive information.</li>
                  <li><b>Availability-related Threats: </b>Prevents end users from being able to send or receive email messages.</li>
              </ul>
            </p>
            <header>
              <h3>Solutions to Secure Emailing</h3>
            </header>
            <p>
              Client-side solutions such as Secure/Multipurpose Internet Mail Extension 
              (S/MIME) or pretty good privacy (PGP) can solve this problem, but they 
              require users’ involvement. A better place to focus security efforts is 
              on securing SMTP.
              STARTTLS is the ESMTP keyword used to initiate a secure SMTP connection 
              between two servers using the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) (also known as TLS). 
            </p>
            <header>
              <h3>STARTTLS</h3>
            </header>
            <p>
              It is an SMTP security extension. It enables SMTP Client and Server to 
              negotiate use of Transport Layer Security (TLS).
              Once the connection has been successfully established all further communication 
              between the two servers is encrypted. This means that the source and destination 
              email address and the entire message contents are all encrypted during transfer.   
            </p>
            <header>
              <h3>SMTP MTA-STS</h3>
            </header>
            <p>
             SMTP MTA-STS (SMTP Mail Transfer Agent Strict Transport Security) is a proposed 
             standard that makes it possible to send downgrade-resistant email over SMTP. 
             In that sense, it is like an alternative to DANE. It does this by being carried 
             by the browser Certificate Authority model. SMTP MTA-STS is a mechanism enabling 
             mail service providers to declare their ability to receive Transport Layer Security 
             (TLS) secure SMTP connections, and to specify whether sending SMTP servers should 
             refuse to deliver to MX hosts that do not offer TLS with a trusted server certificate.

              <br />
              <p>
                Email Safeness Scorer: A privacy preserving machine learning based Client-Side 
                (Mozilla Thunderbird Pugin) to provide safeness score of an email for alerting 
                the user about possible phishing, scam etc.  
              </p>
              <p>
                The email safeness scorer gives the safeness score of the emails based on its 
                content, the low safeness score signifies the dubious, scam, phishing, malicious 
                or spam emails, whereas the high score tells that the email is safe i.e. the email 
                is free from malicious intentions. Nowadays, emails have become a common means of 
                sharing information. Malicious users use this medium for sending unsolicited messages 
                for either advertising their product and services or for enticing gullible users for 
                sharing their important information. This kind of message is generally referred to as 
                spams. Spams are undesired emails, which are unsolicited bulk messages sent through 
                email for advertising, phishing or inflicting malware on the recipient system.

              <h3>Types of email Phishing</h3>
            </header>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Deceptive Phishing:</b> This is the most common type of phishing attack wherein 
                    a cybercriminal impersonates a known popular entity, domain or organization 
                    in the email and attempt to steal sensitive private information from the victim 
                    such as login, password, bank account detail, credit card detail, etc. This type 
                    of attack lacks sophistication as it does not have personalization and customization 
                    for the individuals. For an example, emails containing Phishing URL is disseminated 
                    in bulk to large users as a volume of mail is very high the cybercriminal would expect 
                    that many users will open the emails and visit the malicious URLs or open the infected 
                    attachments. The idea behind this type of phishing is deception and impersonation. 
                    This type of email mostly creates panic and urgency for the victims to divulge sensitive 
                    information. The email subject will be such that it might create urgency such as 
                    "Your account has been hacked, change your password immediately!", "Your bill is overdue-pay 
                    immediately of pay fine!" or other similar messages, once a user open such messages or visit 
                    the URLs the damage is done.
                </li>
                <li><b>Spear Phishing:</b> In this type of phishing emails contain an abundance of personalization 
                    information about the prospective victim. The email might contain the name, company name, 
                    designation or his friends, colleagues and other social information of the recipient. 
                    The proliferation of the company website, personal website and social media enables cybercriminals 
                    to get such details and assist them in forging a very convincing email.
                </li>
                <li><b>Whale Phishing: </b>This type of phishing targets business leaders such as CEO of top-level 
                    management employees to spear phish a "whale", here top-level executive such as CEO. 
                    The main aim of this type of phishing is to gather confidential information from the CEO 
                    and impersonate as CEO. This attack can render maximum damage to company financial prospects, 
                    market value, and reputation.
                    <br/>
                    The spam and fraud detection have become a priority for the security of email these days. 
                    Various algorithms have been devised for detecting spams, while some are successful and effective 
                    on the other hand others are highly biased and need regular training. We have created a three-layer 
                    adaptive neural network for deriving the safeness score for the emails, we further devised an 
                    innovative algorithm to find out the optimized learning rate parameter of Gradient Descent algorithm 
                    for training the neural networks. We trained the neural network with the dataset containing equal 
                    numbers of spam and benign emails sad found that the prediction of safeness score to be very accurate 
                    for the spam emails as compared with the existing approach. We have also developed a plugin for 
                    Mozilla Thunderbird which would collect the content of the email and send this content to a server 
                    asynchronously and at server, we have implemented a three-layer neural network (Email Safeness Scorer) 
                    and also trained it, upon receiving the content the trained spam filter would predict the safeness 
                    score for the received email and would also return the result to the Mozilla Thunderbird, which the 
                    plugin would display to the user. The schematic architecture diagram for an email spam filter is given below.
