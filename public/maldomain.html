            The World Wide Web has seen tremendous increase of traffic in the
            whole of Internet infrastructure leaving several loopholes consequently
            paving way for more and more cyber threats. In fact, the WWW has also 
            become a platform for directly or indirectly supporting malicious 
            activities happening in the cyber space. One such malicious activity 
            happening at an alarming rate on the cyber space is the downloading or 
            spreading of malware. The primary means of the propagation or spreading 
            of malware is through URLs (Uniform Resource Locators) hosted by domains 
            created with harmful intents referred to as malicious domains or else 
            through compromised websites. While the domains refer to the domain names 
            listed at the Domain Name System (DNS), they may also be malicious in nature, 
            disseminating malware, hosting phishing or spam or scam webpages, or 
            facilitating command and control (C&C) communications. The detection of such 
            malicious domains has become important for ensuring network and 
            infrastructural security and preserving privacy.

              Malicious domains are one among the primary resources leveraging 
              attacks over the Internet. These malicious domains used for constructing 
              malicious URLs are a very common and serious threat to the security of 
              cyberspace. They can be used to lure users into becoming victims when 
              they visit its phishing, drive-by downloads, spam and other contents, 
              which may result in compromise of user's privacy, or may incur financial 
              loss or may result in a malware installation onto the user's machine.

          As shown in Fig.1, the domain name and the subdomain name are the 
          important parts of a URL. The combination of domain name and the 
          subdomain name together form the host name and represents the 
          physical machine on which the resource is hosted.

		        Our approach is based on several features, as of now we have four 
            categories of them which we extract from a given domain name.<br/>
            (a) A blacklist of domain names and IP addresses collated from reliable and reputed resources,<br/>
            (b) DNS-based features extracted with support of various protocols which work on the DNS infrastructure,<br/>
            (c) Web-based features, and finally<br/>
            (d) The lexical features.
